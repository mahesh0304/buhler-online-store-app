# Product App (Vue 3 + TypeScript)

Minimal sample app that implements:
- Header with logo (links to /products), current date/time, cart count (links to /checkout)
- Product List (/products) with section-wise products loaded from `products.json`
- Product Detail (/products/:id)
- Checkout (/checkout) with ability to remove items and total price.

To run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

This is a minimal starter project for review and testing.
